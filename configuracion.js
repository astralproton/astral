// configuracion.js removed: settings UI logic disabled.
// The settings UI was intentionally deleted; keep this placeholder
// in case other modules reference the module path. All configuration
// functionality has been removed and settings are applied via
// existing minimal `applySettings(loadSettings())` calls in `script.js`.
